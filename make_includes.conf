#  If you are looking to change the unit abbreviations presented in the
#  HTML generated by xml_to_html.xsl, then you're looking in the wrong
#  file.  To change the presentation name of units, either edit the
#  x-display parameters in xml_to_html.xsl (e.g., temp-display), OR
#  change xml_to_html.sh to invoke the XSLT processor with the desired
#  value for the x-display parameter or parameters.  This *is* why
#  they are specified as global parameters rather than global variables:
#  so that their settings *can* be overridden through xml_to_html.sh.

#  The C code in xml.c and the XML Style Sheet xml_to_html.xsl need
#  to be in agreement as to (1) the names used for different types
#  of measurements (e.g., data type names), and (2) the symbols used
#  for the units of those measurements.

#  To keep the two in sync, this file is processed by make_includes.c
#  to produce an XSL import file, xml_const.xsl and a C header file,
#  xml_const.h.  The information in those two files is then used
#  to bring agreement about between xml.c and xml_to_html.xsl.

#  So, if you wish to change the name used for a measurement type
#  or a unit, then here's where to start.

# [measurements]
#
#  x [";" y] "=" [z ";" ] d
#
#  x -> DEV_DTYPE_X constant in C; dev_dtypestr(DEV_DTYPE_X) = "z"
#  y -> <xsl:variable name="y" select="'z'"/>
#       When y is omitted, x is used in place of y.
#  z -> String representation of the measurement type.
#       When z is omitted, x is used.
#  d -> Description used in comments
#
#  x and y should not be changed: changing either will necessitate
#  code changes.  A change of x will require changing C code.  A
#  change in y will requiring changing XSLT code.
#
#  If you wish to change the string representation of a measurement
#  type, then supply z or change an existing z.  For instance, to
#  change the name "temp" to "t" for DEV_DTYPE_TEMP measurements,
#  change
#
#      temp=Temperature
#
#  to
#
#      temp=t;Temperature

#       When y is omitted, x is used in place of y.
#  z -> String representation of the unit's abbreviation.

#  If you wish to abbreviation used for a unit, then supply z or change
#  an existing z.  For instance, to use "Hg rather than inHg for inches

#
#      inHg=inches Mercury
#
#  to
#
#      inHg=\"Hg;inches Mercury
